## How
- "I used job counts from LEHD / @ CDP geos to calculate ratios & allocate MSA's GDP to its constituent cities." - [@vr00n](https://twitter.com/vr00n/status/1074052700252164096)


- "I think you could break out government spending from each jurisdiction and look at a cities earnings tax (if they have one)." [Eric Roche, Chief Data Officer, KCMO](https://twitter.com/KansasCityEric/status/1074103460604329984)

-  "...read the methodology in detail and determined its doable to use the same methodology to create city GDP given its reliance on income data." - [NLC Economist not on Twitter via Christiana McFarland, NLC](https://twitter.com/ckmcfarland/status/1074142060872167425)
